# First-task-from-Nexus-Info
This chatbot has been built in accordance with the specifications provided by Nexus Info.
It was created taking inspiration from the *ELIZA chatbot* (1964 - '67) at MIT, made by *Joseph Weizenbaum*.
I would like to thank the *'Identity'* YouTube channel, whom I referred to for the successful completion of the project.
The links for their GitHub repos and YouTube channel have been provided below.
Thank you, for considering!
